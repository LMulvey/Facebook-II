Also, the illusive "you have memories" notification that always appears after you open and close your app for a short amount of time
- Messages
- A completely open, free-speech preaching news feed for your closeted racist and biggoted acquaintances to share eye-opening memes targeted at liberal snowflakes who believe humans deserve respect and equality
